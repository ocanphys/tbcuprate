# TRSB Twisted Bilayer Cuprate Topological Superconductor

This code generates the Hamiltonian and solves the self consistent gap equation to find the superconducting order parameter for a generic commensurate twist.

See [index.npyb](https://github.com/ocanphys/tbcuprate/blob/master/index.ipynb) for more details on generating the Hamiltonian and self consistent mean field treatment of the superconducting order parameter.

[solver.py](https://github.com/ocanphys/tbcuprate/blob/master/solver.py) also contains information on available functions and how to run the code.

After downloading the entire repository to a folder, [solver.py](https://github.com/ocanphys/tbcuprate/blob/master/solver.py) should be run. Most up to date Anaconda package is recommended.
